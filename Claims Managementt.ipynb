        "Furthermore, both the urban (red dots) and rural (blue dots) area has similar trends with both densely packed in the lower premium range (0- 2000). However, the rural area is more widely spread in claim numbers and has more outliers with extremely high claims above 100 compared to urban area. The urban shows outliers too but with less extreme claim count compared to the rural area.  As premium increases, there is less claims with the exception of a few outliers with expensive premium which could mean they are luxirious cars or agricultural vehicles with 24 - 27 claims.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the rural areas showing more claims outlier and widely dispersed distribution, the insurance company needs to pay attention to factors contributing to this outcomes which could be due to bad roads, long mileage on vehicles, theft, accidents and others. The company has to analyse why rural policyholders are exhibiting higher claims and plan to adjust pricing or additional risk management measures in place if it persist.\n",

        "The analysis of the auto insurance dataset has uncovered key patterns and trends that provide valuable insights for optimizing claims management and financial stability in Insurance. By understanding risk factors, areas and claim patterns, the insurance company can make informed decisions to manage their books and stay ahead of trends and situations. Given that insurance inherently involves risk pooling, it is crucial for the company to adopt proactive strategies to mitigate risks, adjust pricing and improve financial solvency. Implementing these insights will enable the company to plan better for the future and ensure long-term financial stability in the coming fiscal years."
